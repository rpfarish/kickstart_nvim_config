-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
-- with the first argument being the link and the following
-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
--
-- Use `opts = {}` to automatically pass options to a plugin's `setup()` function, forcing the plugin to be loaded.
--

-- Alternatively, use `config = function() ... end` for full control over the configuration.
-- If you prefer to call `setup` explicitly, use:
--    {
--        'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
--        config = function()
--            require('gitsigns').setup({
--                -- Your gitsigns configuration here
--            })
--        end,
--    }
--
-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`.
--
-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do

-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
--
-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
--
-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

-- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments

-- The following comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
-- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
-- place them in the correct locations.

-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
--
--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
--
-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
--
--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
-- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
--
-- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-ðŸ”Œ-plugin-spec`
-- Or use telescope!
-- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
-- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
